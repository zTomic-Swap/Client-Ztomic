# Ztomic-Swap - Zero-Knowledge Atomic Swap Platform

Ztomic-Swap is a decentralized platform that enables private, secure atomic swaps between different tokens (stable coins) using zero-knowledge proofs and commitment schemes.

## Features

### Private Token Swaps
- **Zero-Knowledge Privacy**: Utilizes zero-knowledge proofs to maintain transaction privacy
- **Atomic Swaps**: Ensures both parties receive their tokens or neither does
- **Cross-Chain Compatibility**: Supports swaps across different blockchain networks
- **Commitment-Based Security**: Uses cryptographic commitments to secure the swap process

### Key Components

#### Intent System
- Create and manage swap intents
- Browse available swap opportunities
- Real-time updates for swap status changes
- Interest-based matching system for counterparties

#### Private Swap Protocol
1. **Intent Creation**
   - Initiator creates a swap intent
   - Specifies token pairs and amounts
   - Sets swap parameters

2. **Counterparty Selection**
   - Users can show interest in available swaps
   - Initiators can select preferred counterparties
   - Real-time notification system for matches

3. **Deposit Phase**
   - Initiator deposits tokens with commitment A
   - Counterparty deposits tokens with commitment B
   - Zero-knowledge proofs ensure deposit validity

4. **Withdrawal Phase**
   - Secure withdrawal process using ZK proofs
   - Atomic execution ensures swap completion
   - Protection against front-running

### Technical Architecture

#### Smart Contracts
- ZTomic contract for atomic swaps
- Deposit and withdrawal verification
- Commitment scheme implementation
- Cross-chain message handling

#### Frontend Components
- React-based user interface
- Real-time updates using polling
- Metamask integration for transactions
- Event monitoring and logging

#### Security Features
- Zero-knowledge proof generation
- Commitment scheme verification
- Hash-locked transactions
- Cross-chain message verification

## Implementation Details

### Key Technologies
- Next.js for frontend framework
- Wagmi for Web3 interactions
- ZK-kit for zero-knowledge operations
- TypeScript for type safety

### Data Flow
1. User creates or responds to swap intent
2. System matches parties and facilitates commitment exchange
3. Smart contracts verify deposits and proofs
4. Atomic swap executes with ZK privacy

### Security Measures
- Commitment-based deposit locking
- Zero-knowledge proof verification
- Hash-based secret sharing
- Atomic execution guarantees

## Usage Flow

1. **Connect Wallet**
   - Connect using Metamask or compatible wallet
   - System generates necessary key pairs

2. **Create or Accept Swap**
   - Create new swap intent
   - Browse available swaps
   - Show interest in existing swaps

3. **Complete Swap**
   - Deposit tokens with commitments
   - Verify counterparty deposits
   - Execute withdrawals with proofs
   - Monitor swap completion

## Technical Requirements

- Web3 compatible browser
- Metamask or similar wallet
- Connected to supported networks
- Sufficient gas for transactions

## Security Considerations

- Keep secret phrases secure
- Verify commitment parameters
- Monitor transaction status
- Wait for confirmation of deposits

## Network Support

- Ethereum Sepolia Testnet
- Additional networks planned
